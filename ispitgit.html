<h2>Early life</h2>

<p> Pupin was born on 9 October (27 September, OS) 1858 in the village of Idvor (in the modern-day municipality of Kovačica, Serbia) in Banat,
 in the Military Frontier in the Austrian Empire. He always remembered the words of his mother and cited her in his autobiography, From Immigrant to Inventor (1925):
<br>
“My boy, If you wish to go out into the world about which you hear so much at the neighborhood gatherings, you must provide yourself with another 
pair of eyes; the eyes of reading and writing. There is so much wonderful knowledge and learning in the world which you cannot get unless you can 
read and write. Knowledge is the golden ladder over which we climb to heaven; knowledge is the light which illuminates our path through this life
 and leads to a future life of everlasting glory.”
